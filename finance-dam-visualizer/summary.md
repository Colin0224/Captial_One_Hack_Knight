# Financial Dam Visualizer - Project Summary

## Overview
The Financial Dam Visualizer is a React-based application created for the Capital One Hackathon that uses the metaphor of a water dam to represent personal finances. This innovative approach provides users with an intuitive and engaging way to understand their financial health, cash flow, and spending patterns.

## Key Components

### 1. Dam Visualization
- The water level represents net worth (assets minus liabilities)
- The flow rate represents cash flow (income minus expenses)
- Dam gates represent control over spending and saving
- Interactive controls allow users to simulate different financial scenarios

### 2. Financial Charts
- Spending category breakdown with interactive pie chart
- Cash flow over time displayed with area chart
- Transaction history with filtering capabilities

### 3. Financial Insights
- Personalized insights based on financial data
- Recommendations for improving financial health
- Metrics presented as informative cards

## Technical Implementation

The application is built with:
- React for the UI components and state management
- Styled Components for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Axios for API communication (ready to connect to Capital One API)

## Mockup Data

The application uses mockup data to simulate:
- Account balances and net worth
- Transaction history
- Spending categories
- Income and expenses

## Future Expansion

The application is designed to be easily connected to the Capital One Hackathon API. The API service is already configured in the codebase and commented out until ready to use.

## User Benefits

- Visual understanding of financial health
- Interactive exploration of financial data
- Actionable insights for financial improvement
- Engaging interface that makes finance more approachable
